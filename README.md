An uncompleted C# program intended to play pokey texas holdem autonomously i've been working on for hours
This was intenteded as a money making machine as well as a great learning opportunity for both programming and entrepreneurship.

I personnally mainly worked in the DLLProject folder. Most code there has been written or copied then modified by I,
for our requirements, namely the exceptionnally well made silence macro recorder: https://github.com/lambdacasserole/silence

I also contributed to some of the more mathematical functions hidden somewhere in the Amigo folder.

This project contains tools, frameworks and experiments.

Bad coding hygiene is also omnipresent.

A lot has been learn, that is for sure.
